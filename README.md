# Loan Data Analysis


## Description

> Explore and predict loan classification dataset using descriptive statistics, univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis, and machine learning algorithm.

## Outline

- Data Extraction
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation


## Objective

> Create a system to help predict and calculate if a person will be a loan defaulter or not automatically


## Business Metrics

- Minimise losses of the lenders
- Reducing the risk by predicting customers who are likely to default
- Increasing the profits by improving loan accessbility the cutomers


## Summary of Findings

- The algorithm that has the best performance (84%) in evaluating the results of this prediction is K-nearest Neighbor
- Applicants who have been predicted as non defaulter should have higher chances of loan approval
- From of all the algorithms carried out, the feature that influences the most is the 'Home Ownership'
- Home ownership could signal that a person is responsible and capable of handling loans
- Another view is that home owners could use their house as collateral when asking for loan so that they are charged with the lower interest rate.
